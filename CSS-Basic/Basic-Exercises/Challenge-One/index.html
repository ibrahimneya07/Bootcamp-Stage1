      <h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18</h1>
      <p>
         This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced
         in the film Dead Poets Society and gave names to the band The
         Darling Buds and the book and television series The Darling Buds
         of May. Read it and weep!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Shall</span>  I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
        <li><span>Thou</span>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
        <li><span>Rough</span> winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
        <li><span>And</span> summer's lease hath all too short a date:</li>
        <li><span>Sometime</span>too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
        <li><span>And</span> often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</li>
        <li><span>And</span>every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
        <li><span>By</span> chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</li>
        <li><span>But</span> thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
        <li><span>Nor </span> lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
        <li><span>Nor </span> shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</li>
        <li><span>When</span> in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</li>
        <li><span>So</span> long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</li>
        <li><span>So</span> long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
      </ul>
